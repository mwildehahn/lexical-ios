# Agent Check Reminders

- After every major change and before marking tasks done, run the iOS simulator tests and verify results.
- Ensure the Playground app builds for iPhone 17 Pro (iOS 26.0).
- Update IMPLEMENTATION.md with progress, notes, and next steps before committing.
- Commit only after tests pass and Playground build succeeds (see AGENTS.md for commands).
